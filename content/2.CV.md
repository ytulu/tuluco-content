# Yonathan Solomon Tulu
I am currently freelancing with https://source.parts (also an early lender) to redesign the "$9 computer" from NextThing, all under Creative Commons. This is to serve my life mission of bridging the technological and wealth gap. Several years of experience working in a multitude of roles in Hardware and Software Engineering. This has culminated in a quantum shift towards a Quality Engineer roll as I can both diagnose Hardware and Software issues, where in I resolve them before they reach production by utilizing my many years of experience.
